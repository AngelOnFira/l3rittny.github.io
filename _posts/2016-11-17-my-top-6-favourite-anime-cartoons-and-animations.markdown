<h3>1) Ouran Highschool Host Club</h3>
<p>It's over the top and weird and I love it! It's a not-so subtle paradoy of typical anime and manga tropes and it's just so, so perfect. I've probably re-watched the series at least 5 times and read the manga over twice, which says a lot because I don't normally read non-fiction! If you also love the anime, definitely read the books, or at least the last few chapters! I always seem to go for the underdog so I was rooting for Hikaru.</p>

<h3>2) Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
<p>Guysssss<br>Guysssssssssss<br>BENDING IS SOO COOL! <br>I was so late in the game to watch this series but man am I ever glad I did! I just finished it with Steven a couple weeks ago. As a 21 year old, it seemed a little kiddish at first but it soons grows on you and gets more deep and real. It's about courage, oppression, duty, family, friendship, forgivingness, identity, and training... just about everything. The characters are relatable, and inspirational and it's full of strong female role models too!</p>

<h3>3) Avatar: The Legend of Kora</h3>
<p>Bolin and Pabu though, am I right?<br>This series is awesome! </p>

<h3>4) Bleach</h3>
<p>This anime is overflowing with seriously bad ass characters, being serious and dark(ish?) sometimes but also hilarious! I love an anime that shows how hard work and friendship go a long way. It's full of lovable and inspiring characters. Oh and that music that plays when stuff's about to get real, if you've watched it you know what im talking about. :')</p>

<h3>5) Earth's Mightiest Heroes</h3> 
<p>Like every Marvel superhero ever! Well, not really but they feature tonnnsss of different heros and villians. Also, Hawkeye's original outfit. XD</p>

<h3>6) RWBY</h3>
<p>This is another series that grew on me, slower than airbender but still pretty quickly. At first I found it beautiful bu the dialogue was kind of cheesy. The storey gets more complex and the writing gets better so keep watching it!</p>
