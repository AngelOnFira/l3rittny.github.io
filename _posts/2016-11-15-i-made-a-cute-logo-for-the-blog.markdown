<h3>Adobe Illustrator Makes Logo Making so Easy!</h3>
<p>I'm super happy with my first logo design ever. It's simple but that's exactly why I like it. In case it's not too obvious, it's a cappuccino and the double ampersand (&&) which is used in lots of programming languages as the logical and operator!</p>
